# Apple Store Order Status
![Apple Store Order Status Widget Preview light](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThisIsBenny/iOS-Widgets/main/Apple-Order-Status/previewLight.jpeg)

This widget shows you the status of your Apple Store order. It shows the remaining days until delivery, the product name, product image, order date and delivery date.

_Notice_: The script is only working with order on the german Apple Store. You can provide me your order number + email, so that I'm able to add the support for your language.
