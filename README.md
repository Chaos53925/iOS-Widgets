# iOS-Widgets
This is a Collection of Scripts which can be used with the Scriptable App to create a iOS Widget.

To use the Script, you have to Download the App "Scriptable" from the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scriptable/id1405459188
Then you have to copy & paste the desired script into the Scriptable App. Now you can create a Sciptable widget and select the script in the widget settings.

## Vodafone DE Datavolume

This widget loads the remaining data volume via the MyVodafone API. For this purpose, an automatic login via the cell phone network is performed, therefore it is necessary that the WIFI is not active.

_Roadmap_:
* Caching as Fallback in Case of active WIFI
* Change Background Color
* Add diagramm
* Add GigaDepot volume
