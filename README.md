# iOS-Widgets
This is a Collection of Scripts which can be used with the Scriptable App to create a iOS Widget.

To use the Script, you have to Download the App "Scriptable" from the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scriptable/id1405459188

All widgets can be easily installed via [Widget Hub](https://widget-hub.app/):

## Roadmap
You will find the List of Widgets where I'm working on here: [Roadmap](https://github.com/ThisIsBenny/iOS-Widgets/projects/1)

If you have widget ideas, please feel free and share those ideas with me via GitHub Issue. But there is no guarantee that I will realize the widget idea.
