# iOS-Widgets
This is a Collection of Scripts which can be used with the Scriptable App to create a iOS Widget.

To use the Script, you have to Download the App "Scriptable" from the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/scriptable/id1405459188

Then you have to copy & paste the desired script into the Scriptable App. Now you can create a Sciptable widget and select the script in the widget settings:
