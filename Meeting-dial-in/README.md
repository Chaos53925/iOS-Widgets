# Meeting dial in (Beta-Version)

This widget allows you to save the location of your car, which will then displayed in the widget as a map. So you know exactly where you parked.
If you don't know the way to the car anymore, you can start the navigation to the car's location with one click and let Apple Maps or Google Maps navigate you.

## Notice
Since some services, such as Skype, allow own domains or phone numbers, it cannot be guaranteed that the current search patterns always find all dial-in data.
The search pattern list must be constantly expanded.
If the dial-in data of a meeting should not be recognized, the invitation can be provided under https://github.com/ThisIsBenny/iOS-Widgets/issues/21, so that the list of search patterns can be extended.
