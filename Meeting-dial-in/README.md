## Notice 1
Since some services, such as Skype, allow own domains or phone numbers, it cannot be guaranteed that the current search patterns always find all dial-in data.
The search pattern list must be constantly expanded.
If the dial-in data of a meeting should not be recognized, the invitation can be provided under https://github.com/ThisIsBenny/iOS-Widgets/issues/21, so that the list of search patterns can be extended.

## Notice 2
The small widget isn't supported due to the limited space and the iOS limitation that small Widget aren't interactive
